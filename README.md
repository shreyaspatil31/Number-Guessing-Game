# Number-Guessing-Game
This Java program creates a number guessing game where users attempt to guess a computer-generated number between 1 and 100. The game is interactive, engaging, and efficient due to its well-structured code. 

**Number Guessing Game in Java**

This repository contains a Java program that implements a simple yet interactive number guessing game. In this game, the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

**Game Overview:**
- The game aims to provide an engaging user experience by challenging them to guess a hidden number.
- It utilizes Java's fundamental programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Compile the Java Program:
   ```
   javac GuessingGame.java
   ```
3. Run the Game:
   ```
   java GuessingGame
   ```

**Gameplay:**
1. The game welcomes the user and introduces the rules.
2. The user is prompted to enter their guess.
3. The program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
4. The user continues to guess until they either:
   - Successfully guess the number.
   - Reach the maximum allowed guesses (6 in this implementation).

**Playing Again:**
- After each game, the user is given the option to play again.
- Respond with "Y" or "N" to continue or exit the game.
